# Decentralized Voting Platform

## Overview

This project aims to create a secure and transparent voting platform using blockchain technology. Voters can cast their votes directly on the Ethereum network, ensuring immutability and integrity.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Eliminate the need for a central authority by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Transparency**: All voting records are publicly accessible on the blockchain.
- **Security**: Votes are cryptographically secured and tamper-proof.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a user-friendly front-end using React or other frameworks.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests using Mocha and Chai.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Truffle (for Solidity development)
- Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain for testing)
- Metamask (browser extension for interacting with Ethereum)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-voting.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd decentralized-voting
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Metamask:
   - Connect Metamask to your local Ganache network.
   - Import accounts from Ganache into Metamask.

## Usage

1. Compile and deploy the smart contract:
   ```
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

2. Start the front-end:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

3. Access the voting platform in your browser.

## Smart Contract Details

- `EVM.sol`: Contains the voting logic.
- Define candidates, manage votes, and emit events.
